## Project Overview
The proposed project aims to develop an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for a Supermarket Management System. This diagram will serve as a blueprint, illustrating the relationships between key entities, including customers, products, suppliers, inventory, sales, and employees. By visualizing the system's structure, the ER diagram will enhance understanding of data flow and interdependencies, ultimately facilitating improved database design and management.

The project will encompass identifying entities and attributes, determining relationships and cardinalities, and validating the diagram through feedback from faculty and industry experts. The outcome will be a well-documented ER diagram that supports efficient data management and decision-making within the supermarket environment.

## Objectives and Goals
1. Identify Entities and Attributes: Define the key entities and their attributes involved in the Supermarket Management System, such as customers, products, suppliers, and employees.
2. Determine Relationships and Cardinalities: Analyze and establish the relationships and cardinalities between entities, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.
3. Develop a Comprehensive ER Diagram: Create a detailed ER diagram that accurately represents the system's structure and interconnections.
4. Validate the ER Diagram: Engage with faculty members and industry experts to review and validate the ER diagram, ensuring its accuracy and effectiveness.
5. Document the ER Diagram: Provide comprehensive documentation of the ER diagram, including assumptions, constraints, and explanations of the design choices made during the project.

## Methodology
1. Analysis of Requirements: Conduct a thorough analysis of the Supermarket Management System to understand its functional requirements, data flow, and operational processes.
2. Identification of Entities and Attributes: Identify the primary entities involved, such as customers, products, suppliers, inventory, employees, and transactions, along with their associated attributes (e.g., customer ID, product name, supplier details).
3. Determination of Relationships and Cardinalities: Analyze the relationships between entities and define their cardinalities, such as customer-product purchases and supplier-product associations.
4. Drafting the ER Diagram: Create an initial draft of the ER diagram, incorporating the identified entities, attributes, and relationships while considering different relationship types.
5. Review and Validation: Present the ER diagram to faculty members and industry experts for feedback and validation, making necessary adjustments based on their insights.
6. Final Documentation: Document the finalized ER diagram comprehensively, explaining any assumptions, constraints, and the rationale behind the design choices made during the process.

## ER Diagram
The Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for the Supermarket Management System will visually represent the relationships between the identified entities. 

> The ER diagram is available for review in the accompanying documentation.


****

## Logical Model
The Logical Model for the Supermarket Management System provides a detailed representation of the data structure that outlines how data will be organized, without being dependent on any specific database management system. This model focuses on the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

> The Logical Model is available for review in the accompanying documentation.

****

## Relational Schema
The Relational Schema for the Supermarket Management System outlines the structure of the database in terms of tables, their attributes, and the relationships between them. Each table corresponds to an entity, and the schema defines primary keys (PK), foreign keys (FK), and the relationships among these tables.

> The Relational Schema is available for review in the accompanying documentation.


****

## Functional Dependencies
Functional dependencies are crucial for understanding the relationships between attributes within a relational schema. They establish how one attribute (or a group of attributes) uniquely determines another attribute. 

Below are the key functional dependencies for the Supermarket Management System:

## Normalization
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The goal is to ensure that each piece of data is stored only once and that relationships between data are properly defined. Below is an overview of the normalization process applied to the Supermarket Management System, progressing through the first three normal forms (1NF, 2NF, and 3NF).

1NF:
- No repeating groups
- Each attribute contains atomic values.
- The relations already satisfy 1NF

2NF:
- 1NF
- All the non-key attributes are dependent on the entire primary key
- The relations already satisfy 2NF

3NF:
- 2NF
- No transitive dependencies
- The relations already satisfy 3NF
